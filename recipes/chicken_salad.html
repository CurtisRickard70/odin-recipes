<body>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 cups cooked chicken, shredded</li>
        <li>1/2 cup mayonnaise</li>
        <li>1/4 cup dill relish</li>
        <li>2 boiled eggs, chopped</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <p>In a large bowl, combine the cooked chicken, mayonnaise, dill relish, and chopped boiled eggs.
        Mix well until all ingredients are evenly coated with mayonnaise. Add more mayonnaise to make the salad creamier, if desired.
        Season with salt and pepper to taste. Chill in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes before serving to allow the flavors to meld together.
        Serve the chicken salad on a bed of lettuce, in a sandwich, or with crackers. Enjoy!</p>
