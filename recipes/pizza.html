    <p><h2><strong>Ingredients:</strong></h2>
    </p>
    <ul>
     <p><h3><em>Dough</em></h3>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 package of active dry yeast</li>
        <li>2 tablespoon sugar</li>
        <li>3/4 cup warm water (about 110°F or 43°C)</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
    
    <h3><em>Sauce and Toppings</em></h3>
    
        <li>1/2 cup tomato based pizza sauce</li>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese/pizza</li>
        <li>graded parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup pepperoni</li>
        <li>pizza toppings</li>
        <li>crisco shortening</li>
        </ul></p>
    <p><h3><em>Instructions</em></h3></p>
    <p>Add and mixed dry ingredient on a bowl.
        Next add dry yeast to warm water mixing until the yeast is dissolved.
        Once the yeast is dissolved add it to the dry ingredients and mix well.
        The dough should mix to be a little tacky, let it rest for about 45-60 minutes to rise.
        The dough should double in size, once it does it is ready to be used.
        Preheat the oven to 375°F.
    </p>
    <p>Spread a thin layer of shortening on each sheet pan. This will help prevent the dough from sticking.
        Once the dough has risen, punch it down and divide it into 2-4 equal pieces.
    </p>
    <p>Roll out the dough on a floured surface to your desired thickness.
        Place the rolled out dough on the sheet pan with the shortening.
        Spread the pizza sauce evenly over the dough leaving a small border around the edges.
        Sprinkle the mozzarella cheese and parmesan cheese over the sauce.
        Add your favorite toppings such as pepperoni and other toppings.
        Bake in the preheated oven for about 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is bubbly.
        Remove from the oven and let it cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</p>
